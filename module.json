Due to the advanced compact nature of the ammunition, two Cartridge rounds can be loaded into a weapon with a single reload interact action. Weapons with magazines automatically eject their casings. Cartridges are capable of being fired underwater and are not ruined by exposure to water, but long-term exposure may cause them to leak."

An additional action with the concentrate trait can be used to activate the grenade, when you do so, the grenade explodes sooner, allowing you to place its center point in the air and causing it to detonate immediately upon reaching its target."
